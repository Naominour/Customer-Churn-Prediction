# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using logistic regression, helping businesses identify customers at risk of leaving. 
By analysing customer data such as contract details, monthly charges, and service usage, we can take proactive steps to improve retention and enhance customer satisfaction.

ðŸš€ **Features**
**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):**

â€¢ Data ingestion from CSV files

â€¢ Cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)

â€¢ Feature engineering to improve model performance

**Predictive Modelling:**

â€¢ Logistic regression model for churn prediction

â€¢ Train-test split for evaluation

â€¢ Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

**Visualisation:**

â€¢ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib

â€¢ ROC Curve visualisation to measure model performance

ðŸ“Š **Dataset**

We used the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which includes:

**Demographics:** Gender, age, partner, and dependent status

**Account Information:** Contract type, payment method, tenure, and monthly charges

**Services Signed Up:** Internet service, online security, tech support, and more

**Churn Status:** Indicates whether the customer has left the service

ðŸ”§ **Technologies Used**

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Version Control:** GitHub
